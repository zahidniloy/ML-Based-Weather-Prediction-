# ClimateWins: ML-Based Weather Prediction Project 🌦️

### Overview
This project series applies machine learning to forecast pleasant weather conditions across various European cities.

Developed for a fictitious non-profit—**ClimateWins**—these models aim to support climate resilience and planning efforts amid changing global conditions. The work includes exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and model comparison using real-world meteorological data collected from 18 weather stations.
